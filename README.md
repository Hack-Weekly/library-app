# library-app

A simple app for keeping track of read or unread books with a firebase backend

This was an assignment in the Odin Project but instead of doing it in Vanilla JS I decided to do it in react and give it a firebase backend for authentication, also using vite



# Features

The user is able to add books to the library, specifying the title, author, page count and whether or not it was read.

The cards have a button to remove them and a button to toggle whether or not the book was read

If the user decides to authenticate a welcome banner appears, there is also a logout button

And if the user decides to click the surprise link they get a surprise :)
